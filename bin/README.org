* Commands for RabbitMQ plugin

  One mode for the RabbitMQ plugin to run is as its own workers as is specified in the Neater plugin.
  This can be used to fully implement workers in a distributed manner, or strictly for debugging so
  other means can be implmented to do the evaluations later.

  The approach is entirely up to you.

** Commandline activation

*** NeatMQ
    The neatmq command shall execute the worker as specified in the Neater. The Neater worker shall be
    called with an entry taken from RabbitMQ, and the results returned from that shall be shot back
    through the RabbitMQ reply_to queue.
